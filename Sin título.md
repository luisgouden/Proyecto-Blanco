Zeliie looked at the horizon, her eyes filling with a sea of dying fireflies. The sky, tinged with a pearly grey, seemed like an infinite canvas where the lights flickered with a final breath of life.

In the distance, she could make out some ruins that, surrounded by so much deathly whiteness, stood out like a beacon as the only thing unlit. The crumbling structures rose like shadows of a forgotten past, their outlines blurred by time. Although the light of Kel here was a mere shadow compared to that of her native dimension, out of habit, she raised her left hand as a visor and tried to look beyond the ruins. But, becoming aware of what she was doing, she turned her head abruptly. The wound was still too fresh, at least for her.

Suddenly, she no longer wanted to move, she had no energy, but she began to walk heavily, as always. Apparently, she was expected and had important things to do, important enough to write books about.

She could hardly believe it.

Everything, except her, seemed to be motionless. Her footsteps left no trace on the silvery surface, but with each step, a fine, almost imperceptible, shimmering dust rose for an instant, only to settle back in the same place as if no one had been there, since there was no wind.

As in an eternal dawn, there was no day or night there, for Kel, though faint, was always present, orphaned like her, without a single star to accompany him in the vast pearly sky. Even time seemed alien, suspended in an unsettling calm…

An itch began to spread up her arm. It had become something usual whenever Zeliie felt nostalgic. It was almost reaching the second seal, near her elbow.

<<If they saw me now… What would little Rin say about me?>> she thought. The itch had almost reached her elbow.

“Why aren’t you moving?” Zeliie was startled. “Are you hungry? Should I be?”

She turned her face. There was Shire, floating beside her, inert, like the rest of the planet. Was she looking at her? Maybe not.

“Just musing,” she said harshly, looking away.

“I know that already,” Shire replied mockingly, in her mind. “But why aren’t you moving? Humans are very strange. Can’t you do two things at once?”

She shook her head and continued walking, faster this time.

“Why the rush?” Zeliie asked as she searched for her again. “I still don’t understand what we’re going to do.”

“We’re expected,” Shire replied dryly. “Suuri, we have to go to Suuri.”

Hearing that name, she felt a shiver. It had been a long time since she returned to her city… Would it have changed much after what happened?

The pain was almost reaching her shoulder now, though it was advancing more slowly.

“Zeliie, you’ve stopped again,” Shire said impatiently. “Are you sure you’re not hungry?”

She looked at her feet in surprise. Unintentionally, she had stopped again, daydreaming. She definitely needed to leave that place and interact with living beings again, no matter how much they irritated her. That way, she could continue being herself.

“Tell me again why we’re walking,” Zeliie demanded. “You know you’re a terrible companion? You give me a headache.”

“Everything will start with us walking, well, I don’t walk, but you know what I mean. We’ll be talking about any nonsense like you being hungry or, for example, the book they’re going to write about us. The prologue will start with us moving, because I don’t walk, you’ll complain and utter one of your famous blasphemies…”

“Famous?” Zeliie put on her best indignant face, though somewhat unpractised. “But I’m as good as… where were the words when you needed them, she thought… a freshly baked cream bun.”

In the end, it was true that she was hungry.

“…that you usually say when contradicted or simply stared at more than usual,” Shire continued as if she hadn’t heard her.

“You’ll be id…, you’ll be br…,” damn seals and damn being of the multiverse, she cursed inwardly, “brainless.”

“I said a blasphemy, not something obvious at first glance. I thought you were more witty.”

Shire began to circle around her, manifesting with a mocking face. Making herself as visible as a translucent floating entity could be.

“You should try to hook the readers with one of your vulgar phrases,” Shire continued torturing her. “Something cursing Val or saying that Kel doesn’t shine or any of the things you living beings say in this _now_.”

“Val?” she asked. “Another of your invented goddesses?”

“It’s true… That in this _reality_ you don’t worship her… Well… Let me think… Diana Prince?”

“Eeeehh…” She tried something impossible: ignoring Shire. She continued walking calmly through the white desert, trying to leave her behind.

“I’m in your head, you can’t ignore your thoughts…”

“Shut up!” she stomped on the ground, raising white dust. “I know where you are, but if I try really hard, I can pretend I do. Besides, that book you keep talking about doesn’t keep me up at night, whatever will be, will be… I suppose. Now we have to get to the Radiant city of Suuri, right? That’s where he will be, right?”

“More or less, I don’t know if he or she will seek us out, that’s their decision. I just see that we must go there,” Shire continued.

“Sometimes I wish I could squeeze you and turn you into simple thought dust and…” she began to say in frustration.

“I love myself too, thanks,” Shire interrupted her with irony.

To her surprise, the itch was gone.

But as always when she argued with Shire, she was ravenously hungry.

She set off again, forcibly ignoring the ruins of the library she was leaving behind.
